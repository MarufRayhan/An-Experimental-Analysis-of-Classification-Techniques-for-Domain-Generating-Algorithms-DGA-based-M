# Domain Generating Algorithm (DGA) Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of multiple machine learning models for detecting malicious domain names generated by Domain Generating Algorithms (DGAs). The project utilizes 13 state-of-the-art classification techniques to analyze a diverse dataset of 80 different DGA families. The research paper associated with this work was published in the 2020 23rd International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT).

## Features
- Experimental analysis of 13 machine learning classifiers
- Three text feature extraction methods: unigram, bigram, and trigram
- Binary classification of domains (malicious vs. benign)
- Comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Tested on 80 different DGA families for robust detection

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Additional dependencies as specified in the notebooks

## Running the Notebooks
This project is provided as Jupyter notebooks, which can be run in:
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook
- JupyterLab

The main notebook is `Modified_final_updated_26_07_2020.ipynb`, which contains the implementation and evaluation of all 13 classification models.

### Configuration Parameters
You can adjust the following parameters in the notebook:
- `n1 = 2` (n-gram parameter)
- `n2 = 2` (n-gram parameter)
- `model_name = "MultinomialNB"` (classifier selection)


## Dataset
The models are trained on a dataset containing:
- 39,458 malicious domain names from 80 different DGA families (obtained from DGArchive)
- 40,000 benign domain names from the Majestic Million list of top-ranked domains

The dataset includes both Traditional DGAs (producing pseudo-random domains) and Dictionary-based DGAs.

## Classifiers Implemented
The following machine learning classifiers are implemented and evaluated:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
3. Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
4. Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB)
5. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
6. Nearest Centroid
7. Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC)
8. Decision Tree
9. Random Forests
10. Bagging
11. AdaBoost
12. Gradient Boosting
13. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)

## Performance Highlights
Our experiments achieved:
- Maximum accuracy: 80.6% (MultinomialNB and LinearSVC)
- Maximum precision score: 99.8% (KNN)
- Maximum recall score: 94.8% (AdaBoost)
- Maximum F1 score: 78.7% (MultinomialNB)

Detailed performance metrics for each classifier with different feature extraction techniques are provided in the notebooks.

## Significance
This research is particularly valuable for:
- Network defenders combating botnet communications
- Cybersecurity professionals seeking effective methods to detect algorithmically generated domains
- Researchers studying the effectiveness of machine learning in malware detection

## Future Work
- Implementation of multiclass classification to identify specific DGA families
